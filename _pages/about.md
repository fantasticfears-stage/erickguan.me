A CS student studying in Mid Sweden University, at Sundsvall, Sweden. I'm from
Sanming, China.

In free time, I contribute to Discourse and OSS coding.
I love to build things, video games, sports and make new friends. And I enjoy cultural differences.

I support [Chinese Discourse community](https://meta.discoursecn.org)
by plugins, guides, translations and answers.

I use PGP to ensure privacy and sign documents. [My PGP key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x10075E9E76407351) 76407351
I was a Gentoo user and love to build my system.

I also like to read books about political, civilization, art and finance.
