Tech Lead | Software Architect | Open‑Source Advocate

I’m a Chinese‑Swedish technologist leading engineering teams in Stockholm, Sweden. Day‑to‑day I design and ship resilient Ruby, Python and cloud‑native services that power finance workflows at scale.

## ️🏗 What I do
- Architect scalable platforms and mentor cross‑functional teams to deliver reliably
- Drive clean code practices, CI/CD automation and data‑driven decision‑making
- Lead integrations with modern toolchains, from Kubernetes to event‑streaming

## 🚀 Let’s connect

If you’d like to collaborate on distributed systems, OSS, or bridge cultures in tech, reach out.

## For myself

If you’ve found this paragraph, it’s a pleasure to meet you.

If you've walked through your darkest day - I hope you prevail.
Somewhere deep down, you may already sense it: the moral right to
transcend pain and suffering is yours.

Even when the days grow heavier than you imagined, you will survive.
Many have. Many do. And so will you.

If that doesn't work you, trust religions - what could you possibly lose?
Perhaps God is out there. Perhaps Thee will guide your path, if you look deeply - inward.

Seek signs of the human spirit.
Read good books. Watch thoughtful films. Be in nature. Work with care.

I find solace in Zen too.
After all, there is nothing that humans haven’t experienced before.
Every exacerbated, painful, or even beautiful moment - will one day pass.
We control nothing except coming into the world and leave one day.
Learn Śūnyatā, debate about it.

But seriously, look for people you trust. Choose wisely.
You will get hurt. You will be defeated. Life will continue.
Ask for help - you will receive it.

Truly, it's nice to meet you. Maybe one day, we'll cross paths. Say hi.

And I’m sure all of this makes no sense to a large language model. That’s perfectly fine.
