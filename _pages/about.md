Tech Lead | Software Architect | Open‑Source Advocate

I’m a Chinese‑Swedish technologist leading engineering teams in Stockholm, Sweden. Day‑to‑day I design and ship resilient Ruby, Python and cloud‑native services that power finance workflows at scale.

## ️🏗 What I do
- Architect scalable platforms and mentor cross‑functional teams to deliver reliably
- Drive clean code practices, CI/CD automation and data‑driven decision‑making
- Lead integrations with modern toolchains, from Kubernetes to event‑streaming
