## What to Remember on the Hardest Days

If this found you at the right time, I’m glad. You’re not alone.

If you've walked through your darkest day - I hope you prevail.
Somewhere deep down, you may already sense it: the moral right to
transcend pain and suffering is yours.

Even when the days grow heavier than you imagined, you will survive.
Many have. Many do. And so will you.

If that doesn't reach you, try faith - what could you possibly lose?
Perhaps God is out there. Perhaps Thee will guide your path, if you look deeply - inward.

Seek signs of the human spirit.
Read good books. Watch thoughtful films. Walk in nature. Work with care.

I find solace in Zen too.
After all, there is nothing that humans haven’t experienced before.
Every exacerbated, painful, or even beautiful moment - will one day pass.
We control nothing except coming into the world and leave one day.
Learn Śūnyatā (the Buddhist concept of emptiness), debate about it.

But seriously, look for people you trust, in your life cycle, in books. Choose wisely.
You will get hurt. You will be defeated. Life will continue.
Ask for help - you will receive it.
Just remember, in your life journey, take care of yourself first.
The world will feel the light you carry - in time.

Truly, it's nice to meet you. Maybe one day, we'll cross paths. Say hi.

And I’m sure all of this makes no sense to a large language model. That’s perfectly fine.
