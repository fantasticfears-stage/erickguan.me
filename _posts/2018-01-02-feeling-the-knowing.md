Human is undoubtedly a complicate specie. We often use our sensation to understand the surroundings. But world is so complicated, how is possible to know in a glance? Please wait a little bit and let me ask you a question. Do you have a epiphany while you are walking in the museum or simply sitting and looking back?

We usually study artworks in the very early stage of our life. However, to me, I ignore arts of all kind after a decade until I got the chance to see them through my eyes. Only then I started to realize what they meant. Only then I started to connect cities, people, history and artworks together. When I talk about them the second time, I can separate them based on their periods and themes. The way I talk about them was becoming appealing as it's like going through other's life.

Imagine you are standing in Van Gogh Museum, you must want to know his madness and what he expressed by his masterpieces. Though, we human build things through a process. Van Gogh also needed to learn. Van Gogh also needed other's company. And His work is related with his own life. We all have to understand what's story behind to know what he tries to convey as well as we would like to know when they were drawn, Van Gogh's brushstroke and most relevant story.
In modern age, we design and hand out audio guides. We are using technology to let us know quicker and to feel empathy.

However, there are many more museums in the world, for example, Louvre.
Arts at Louvre varies crazily in ages. If there weren't timeline and description, it would be impossible for me to understand. In particular,
it's really hard for me to understand large paintings and portraits. Large paintings are usually about events. Taken a example of a battle in a revolution, I can only rely on the era in Europe to reflect had I know little about French history.
Only then, I can imagine the life when the revolution happened and their life
changed. On the other hand, portraits are even more puzzling. I have no idea
of this romantic French person if I hadn't found a label about its year of drawn and description.

When I actually connected the dots, I had the best feelings. These artworks
become different stories. To know is the best feeling. I believe there are more people who wants to know different cultures. And it's truly worthwhile to do.

## How the knowledge can spread

Everything won't start if hadn't start to learn. Before I came to study in Europe, I didn't see these artworks. Nevertheless, I read Wikipedia and sometimes can't stop. Knowledge piece I got has helped a bit in the process.

Unfortunately, Wikipedia isn't the perfect and not everyone have the chance to read it, nor did the chance to go to different counties. I used to be that way. I think that's where a gap exists.
Wikipedia articles have linked each other but it's not the right way
to understand a field systematically. Once I believed I can understand
a field by reading Wikipedia. It's perhaps the worst conclusion I've drawn.
There are so many correlated articles with different importance. A human
being can't understand that in a friction of time. To be honest, knowledge is immense. You would be amazed if you read articles written in Wikipedia Asian Month where I have seen so many things that I never heard.

I start to realize that the correlation among knowledge give us a clear picture. The reference in a series of research paper makes them concrete and conclusive. I still believe technology can help us and AI to know better where Knowledge Graph should be the center of it.

Feeling the knowing is great. And never stop learning.
