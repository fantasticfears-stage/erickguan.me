Internet profoundly changes human life. I read magazine when I was a kid. It says "Everything at your fingertip". This refers to Internet. It finally becomes truth however terrifying reality.
People start to live in the matrix and feed on their own biases. Yet nobody
sells happiness.

# Social app

Being social is a fundamental need of human. We used to work together for food
and raise children. It's hard wire to our brian and defines feelings. But we are
also mammals. Mammals look for variety. Internet and social apps give us this  unbelieve variety. Without working on it, we get choices. Dating apps are a great
example, swiping gives you dominating feelings and infinite choices. It works and
it works like a mirage. Enterprenurs and engineers are working so hard to provide
this options to us. They designs the gaint machine cluters running on their algorithm which made by few's mind. They made it **easy and fun**. It's a great gamification. It's highly addictive too.
Though, this is detrimental too. Tinder uses an ELO algorithm to ensure you are
not going to see people outside your range (score). But life isn't like this.
Life has surprises. Meeting people brings enjoyment. Flirting requires
skills and practices. And someone at the door might have the answer you are looking for your own development. The habit swiping destroies the joy. It's fake.

# People don't read

We are a speicies feed on information. We even have a thinking on computer engineering that thinks information + context = knowledge. Knowledge is also written on language. We are incredible because we read. We learn from our greatest so that we don't make the same mistakes. In fact, we would die much easier without penicillin. We wouldn't be able to predict weather without air balloon and mathematics. We wouldn't be able to watch Netflix without decades of
technological development. Yet people don't read. We are starting to transit from
learning from text to learning from images and videoes. **Reading builds knowledge structure but videoes only conveys feelings.** Reading is fundamental.
No matter who you are.

## Why people don't read?

I think learning is always a hard process. You have to put so many hours in
reading something you don't know. That feels uncomfortable. Maybe many people
don't have the epiphany moment. That brings you all the joy of learning. It's
generally true that you can learn whatever you want on the internet. Knowledege
is accessisble than ever but people are lack of motivation. It might not lead
to a perfect job. It doesn't give you better income.

> Difficulty is a process of mastering your craft. -- Qunicy

This might have two different perspectives. Let's start with hardest one.

## Developing world

If people don't have accessible internet, our assupmtion does not exist. People
lives on their instincts and social codes. They are people living in 1960s.

Then comes the Chinese. Rapid growth drives technology advancement and internet.
It builds gigantic gap between rich and poor but internet connects them together.
Widely accessible information without privacy filter is terrible. Your need grows
exponentially with the new information. But not your financials. Comprasion between real life and life on
photos draw pain and desire. No wonder Chinese are greedy in their relationships.
The idea of better life requiring money is an **illusion** of not acknowledge time and development.

## First World problem

Living in a developed world means knowledge and books are accessible. So does
the internet and smart phones. It's much comfortable to live in bubbles. You only
needs to react when your life is at stake. Thanks to widely accessible higher
education and good life quality. Living in 20s are fun. Endless choices among other young people and internet is always fun. It also developes comfortable numb. Being able to push yourself is the way to grow. And the only way to become
is to work through pain. Many people don't go to find that drive. They are not
actually living.

# Happiness needs work

I love Yuval's choice of buddhist's view.

> If I identify happiness with fleeting pleasant sensations, and crave to
> experience more and more of them, I have no choice but to pursue them constantly. When I finally get them, they quickly disappear, and because the
> mere memory of past pleasures will not satisfy me, I have to start all over
> again. Even if I continue this pursuit for decades, it will never bring me
> any lasting achievement; on the contrary, the more I crave these pleasant
> sensations, the more stressed and dissatisfied I will become. To attain real
> happiness, humans need to slow down the pursuit of pleasant sensations, not
> accelerate it.

Just like a concrete work, it requires constantly tweaking and coping. Life applies.
